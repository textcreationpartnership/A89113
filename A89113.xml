         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As to the exceptions, that his Maj. ſaid nothing to the conſenting to a Bill, for the utter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhing of Archbiſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c. Nor that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance for aboliſhing them be confirmed by Act of Parl. his Maj. ſaith, that in his former anſwer he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:162318:3"/>in that paper is expreſſed: yet finding by your ſaid paper of the 30. of Sept. that not to be ſatisfactory, his Maj. with all clearneſſe will acquaint you what was his aym therein: His Maj. therefore declares, That the reaſon why he did not anſwer to that part of your Propoſition, in terms as is propoſed, was, becauſe he was not ſatisfied in his Conſcience; He can be content to the utter aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Epiſcopacy, the ſubſtance whereof he conceives to conſiſt in the power of Ordination, and jurisdiction, as they were exerciſed by the Apoſtles themſelves, and others, by Authority derived from them, ſupe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s 2. Houſes for the alteration and regulating of his preſent Hierarchy. And if his two Houſes ſhall ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, his Majeſtie will be content to leſſen the extent, and multiply the number of Dioceſſes. 2. As to the excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That his Maj. hath not expreſſed his conſent for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Biſhops Lands upon Truſtees, and for the ſale of thoſe Lands, its true he hath not, to alienate the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of thoſe Lands, &amp; herein he believes he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current opinions of many Divines, that in other points differ much among themſelves, but his former anſwer containing a large offer of ſatisfaction to all thoſe that have purchaſed, or disburſed monies upon thoſe Lands.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:162318:4"/>
               <p>Thirdly, As to that part of the Propoſition for the calling and ſiting of the Aſſembly of Divines His Maj ſaith that he will by Act of Parliament confirm the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſiting of the ſaid Aſſembly of Divines, ſince the firſt of July 1643.</p>
               <p>And that they ſhall have ſuch powers as is mentioned in the ſaid Ordinance, and that they ſhall continue their meeting and ſiting, and be diſſolved in ſuch manner as both houſes of Parl. ſhall direct.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, His Maj. will confirm the publick uſe of the Directory, in all Churches and Chappels, as is deſired in the Propoſition. And will conſent to the repeale of ſo much of all Statutes, as only concerns the Liturgy, and alſo the taking away out of all Churches and Chappels provided that the uſe thereof may be continued in his Majeſties Chappel, for himſelfe and for his own houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</p>
               <p>His Maj. will likewiſe conſent that the form of church Government preſented to him, be confirmed by Act of Parl. for 3 yeares, provided onely that a conſultation <hi>in</hi> the mean time be had with the Aſſembly of Divines, in ſuch a manner and for the purpoſes as are in his former anſwer expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Touching the Articles of Religion his Maj. profeſſeth he hath not had time ſince they were delivered unto him, to looke into them with that deliberation which is requiſite, before he bind up himſelf and his ſubjects in matter of faith and Doctrin and therfore deſires that part of your propoſitions may be reſpited by his two Houſes.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And whereas you deſire to know whither his Maj. by ſaying in his paper of the 13 of Sept, that he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:162318:4"/>will give his Royall aſſent to an Act for the better obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lords day, intends the confirming of the Ordinance preſented unto him.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty thereunto anſwers, that the Bill for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of innovations to which you deſire his conſent which he is willing to give, contains in it full proviſion for the Lords day, and if that be not ſufficient his Maj. will conſent to paſſe an Act to confirm the matter of the Ordinance for ſo much as concerns the obſervation of that day.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, His Maj. conceived that he had fully anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all your deſires, that their might be a ſpeedy courſe taken to prevent the ſaying and hearing of Maſſe in the Court, or any other place of this Kingdom or the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is well known of what profeſſion his Royall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort is, and what proviſion is made by the two Crowns in the Articles of Marriage for her exerciſe thereof, and his Maj. never did nor will conſent to reſtrain her.</p>
               <p>Seaventhly and laſtly, concerning the Covenant and the Ordinance concerning the ſame his Majeſties An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer being, That he was not yet ſatisfied to take it, or impoſe it one others, He conceives his two Houſes will not inſiſt upon it at this time, and the rather, becauſe the ends thereof will be obtained by the agreement if hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyly concluded. Which God grant.</p>
               <p>And for the great buſines of the Militia of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom his Majeſty doth conſent thereto as is ſet down in the Propoſition.</p>
